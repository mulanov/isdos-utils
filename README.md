[iS-DOS] is a disk operating system for [ZX-Spectrum] home computer equipped with a [Beta Disk interface] disk drive controller, which was widespread in the countries of the former USSR.

This section presents programs by Mikhail Ulanov, written in 1995-1997 for the iS-DOS system.

Since iS-DOS was designed for Russian-speaking users, and most of the system programs have a Russian user interface, the programs presented in this section also have only a Russian interface and Russian-language documentation.

All programs are coded using Z-80 assembler.
